Volcanic hazard is the probability of any particular area being affected by a destructive volcanic phenomenon within a given window of time (UNESCO 1972; Fournier d'Albe 1979). The primary goal of volcanic hazard assessment is to forecast hazard at a given geographical location (see Decker 1986; Blong 2000; Newhall and Hoblitt 2002; Marzocchi and Bebbington 2012; Mart√≠ 2017; Poland and Anderson 2020, for reviews).
